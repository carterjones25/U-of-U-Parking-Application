# U-of-U-Parking-Application
 A website that links to a database containing information on University  parking permits, lots, spaces, administrators and students.

 This project was created for a Web-Based Applications course at the University of Utah. 
 See the file "Web App Login Info" for information on how to access the web app.

 The web app has two user groups, students and administrators.
 Students can view and apply for permits, as well as view and pay for violations they may have.
 
 Keep in mind the app was created in an educational setting and any data is purely for testing purposes.
